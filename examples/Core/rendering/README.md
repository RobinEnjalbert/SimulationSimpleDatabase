# Examples - SSD.Core.Rendering

This repository contains a few examples that give a great overviews of the **rendering** features.

Each script will cover a rendering object type to explain how to create it and how to update it.
 * Scripts named ``<backend>_visualization.py`` cover all visual object types (how to create and update them);
 * Scripts named ``<backend>_replay.py`` explain how to replay a simulation from a *Database*;
 * Scripts named ``<backend>_offscreen.py`` show an example of offscreen rendering;
 * Scripts named ``several_factories.py`` explain how to manage several *Factories* with a single *Visualizer*.

Run the examples using ``python3 <example_name>.py``.
